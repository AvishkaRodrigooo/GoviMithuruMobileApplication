# GoviMithuruMobileApplication
An AI-powered platform providing Sri Lankan paddy farmers with personalized guidance throughout the entire cultivation lifecycle - from land preparation to harvest and post-harvest management.

Research Problem

•Inefficient & Reactive Farming: Farmers rely on outdated methods and intuition, making them vulnerable to climate change, pests, and diseases, which leads to inconsistent yields and resource waste.

•Critical Knowledge Gaps: There is a significant lack of access to real-time, hyper-local advisory services for crucial decisions like pest control, weed identification, optimal harvesting time, and proper storage techniques
.
•High Post-Harvest Losses: Significant economic losses occur after harvest due to poor timing, inadequate drying methods in unpredictable weather, and insufficient storage solutions against pests and spoilage.

•Barriers to Technology Adoption: Complex and expensive modern solutions are inaccessible to smallholder farmers, compounded by a lack of personalized guidance for new farmers, hindering the sector's modernization and sustainability.

Research Main Objective

•To design and develop an integrated, AI-driven web platform that provides Sri Lankan paddy farmers with data-guided decision-making support across the entire cultivation lifecycle, aiming to increase productivity, profitability, and resilience against climate and pest risks.

Specific Sub-Objectives & Components

•Pest Attack Forecasting: To predict outbreaks using ML models on historical and real-time weather, crop stage, and pest data, sending proactive alerts to farmers.

•AI-Powered Weed Detection: To accurately identify weed species in real-time using a smartphone camera and computer vision, providing tailored removal guidance.

•Smart Harvest & Post-Harvest Advisor: To determine the optimal harvest time using crop maturity and weather data, and provide science-based storage and selling recommendations to minimize losses.

•Crop Establishment Planner: To assist new farmers by recommending suitable paddy varieties and generating a personalized cultivation calendar based on their specific field's soil, climate, and market data.
